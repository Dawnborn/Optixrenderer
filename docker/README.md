You can now build and use the OptixRenderer inside a docker container. Simply pull the image ```kunalg106/optix``` or build the provided dockerfile. 
Note however that if you are building it yourself then you would need to download the NVIDIA Optix package (ver 5.1.1) from https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/5.1.1/linux64 and place it inside this direcotry. 

Then, follow the instructions from [INTALL-LINUX.txt](../INSTALL-LINUX.txt) to build the renderer.
